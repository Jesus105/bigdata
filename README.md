# Big Data Projects Repository

Welcome to our collection of Big Data projects that address complex analytical challenges using Apache Spark. This repository contains a series of practical experiments designed to familiarize you with various aspects of handling big data using PySpark.

## Experiments Included:

### [Experiment 1: Installing Big Data Tools]
This experiment guides you through setting up the necessary Big Data tools including Apache Spark and Java SDK. Key commands and setup procedures are demonstrated to ensure you have the correct environment for subsequent experiments.

### [Experiment 2: Understanding the PySpark DataFrame]
Dive into the basics of PySpark DataFrames as you load and manipulate datasets. Learn to perform basic data operations such as schema printing, data selection, and simple aggregations.

### [Experiment 3: Handling Missing Values]
Explore methods to handle missing values in a dataset using PySpark. Techniques such as dropping null values, filling them, or predicting missing values with mean or median are covered.

### [Experiment 4: Filter Operation, GroupBy, and Aggregate Functions]
Learn to refine your data with filter operations and aggregate functions to summarize data. This notebook teaches you how to use grouping to gain more insights from your data.

### [Experiment 5: Facebook Dataset Handling]
A practical session on handling a real-world dataset from Facebook. You will perform data loading, querying, and basic analytics to uncover patterns in social media data.
